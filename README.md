Aoxi's dotfiles
========

#install

Run this:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/aoxili/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
make
```

or ` make tmux zsh ` if you are interested in my tmux and zsh settings.

`Makefile` will symlink the appropriate files in `.dotfiles` to your home directory.
Everything is configured and tweaked within `~/.dotfiles`.
